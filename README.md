# Next.js Example Project

## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This project was built from the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.

### Progress

Completed Chapter 15 of 16.

Only homepage can load and trying to log in crashes the app since the project uses new React hook useActionState which is not supported by current stable versions on Next.js.

### Notes

I used bcryptjs instead of bcrypt.
